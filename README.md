## 100 Days of Swift 5

**More than 16 tiny projects to help you quickly learn how to build a simple iPhone app.**

👉🏼 [中文传送门 / Chinese Version](README-CN.md) 👈🏼

Similar with [samvlu's 100-days-of-swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html), **but write by Swift 5.** Some resource comes from [Edison Hsu](https://github.com/Edison-Hsu/100-days-of-RxSwift).

Code environment:

- Swift 5
- Xcode 11.3.1
- Simulator iPhone 11
- IOS 13.2

These projects does not include an explanation of the basics of Swift. If you do not understand how the code works, please learn the following tutorial first:

- [The Swift Programming Language](https://swift.org/)
- [Stanford CS193P Developing Applications for iOS](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/)

**Happy programming!**

> The code is different from the samvlu's version because I write it myself. Obsolete projects have been deleted and similar projects have been merged together.
